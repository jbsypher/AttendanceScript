# AttendanceScript

During Covid-19, teachers struggled to quickly and accurately take attendance during online courses. 
To solve this, I partnered with local teachers at my school to create an automated attendance tracking system built off of Zoom architecture. 
Built in Python, Batch, HTML, and CSS, my product resulted in significant time savings from as much as 5 minutes, to 5 seconds.
